Just to push something to GitHub about me. I am mixed Japanese and American, and am studying computer science at WCC currently. I think that software speaks to me because I really enjoy the puzzle solving and thought experiments like logic issues. I am a bit put off by the Math required like calculus and beyond, however I still am getting through it and enjoying my time learning. I have a few hobbies that I haven't been able to get around to recently, however I hope I can spend the summer doing that this year.
