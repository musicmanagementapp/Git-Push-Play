Hello! My name is Dylan Suchala, I'm 16 years old and finishing my last class before I take my degree.
I mainly code in C++ but work in other languages as well. I like to code games in my freetime 
but enjoy collecting vinyls, manga, and trinkets on the side. I also am big on travelling and gaming. 
I am currently planning on going to Japan for my last spring break trip as i'm graduating Highschool early!
