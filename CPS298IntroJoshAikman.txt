Hey everyone! My name is Josh Aikman and I'm in the Java program hoping to transfer to EMU to finish my bachelors. I am currently also taking Databases at WCC and working in a restaurant while in school. In my free time I like to play guitar, watch/ play basketball, and spend time outdoors (when its not so cold). I'm excited to get to know all of you more while we work on this project and complete this class!
