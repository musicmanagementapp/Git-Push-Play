Marshall Intro


My name is Marshall Blaser, I am 26 years old. I'm an aviation technician, specializing in Turbine Engine Overhauls, I've also worked on Blackhawks for the past 6 years, am a member of the Washtenaw County Community Band, and am pursuing a computer science degree for hobby based coding and independent development. I'd like to be able to use my skills to create softwares to implement into my work that can be used/sold to others in the industry that may require it.
